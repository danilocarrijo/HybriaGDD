# Gameplay

## Core Gameplay

The core game play in Hybria will be a mix of collecting fighting monsters, solving puzzles and explore the planets.

Fighting – the fighting should be fun and intuitive, the player will have a variety of power to chose to use in battle, but the overall battle should remain simple enough to not match the game theme and keep the player focused on exploration and finding hidden collectables. The main resource to fight the player will have been his sword, like in game of the genre if the sword hits a enemy in a simple collision way, the enemy loses a integer part of its life, and after not a lot of hits (depending on the enemy 2 3 is enough) the enemy will parish. The game should not throw hordes of enemy to the player, the player should be able to pass by a area without having to kill all the monsters in that area. Once killed the monsters can drop either hearts to restore the players life or magic potion to restore player magical power.

Puzzle Solving – The puzzles in Hybria should be dynamic enough that the plyer do loose interest, the game planned to achieve this by having back and forth like puzzle, using the scenario and not focusing only in one portion of some area like in survival horror games, but using the planet theme and mechanics to bring the puzzle alive like in adventure games.
